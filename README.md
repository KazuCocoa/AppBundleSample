In this repository, you can see how to run test `.aab` file with Appium. The `.aab` file is [app-bundle](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/) feature.
`bundletool` hasn't matured yet. So, Appium haven't supported it yet. https://github.com/appium/appium-adb/pull/366

So, to run tests with `.aab`, we need to follow _test.rb_ way.
With 0.6.0, we can't put any options for `adb install` command. We can't use `-g` option, unfortunately.

```
# Build apks with https://github.com/google/bundletool/releases
$ java -jar apks/bundletool-all-0.6.0.jar build-apks \
  --bundle apks/release/release/app.aab \
  --output apks/AppBundleSample.apks \
  --connected-device \
  --device-id emulator-5554 \
  --ks apks/sign \
  --ks-key-alias key0 \
  --ks-pass pass:kazucocoa \
  --overwrite

# Generated by the above command
$ java -jar apks/bundletool-all-0.6.0.jar install-apks \
  --apks apks/AppBundleSample.apks \
  --device-id emulator-5554
```

## Run tests with appium
1. Launch an emulator which is 8.1 and named "emulator-5554"
2. Launch Appium server
3. Run below command

```
$ bundle install
$ ruby test.rb
```

## Lesson
Generating `apks` for a specifit device builds `master`, language and resolution apks. When we unzip generated `AppBundleSample.apks`, we can see below apks for example. We can see application `.class` files in `base-master.apk`. English string resporces in `base-en.apk`. XXHDPI resources in `base-xxhdpi.apk`.

```
base-en.apk
base-master.apk
base-xxhdpi.apk
```

When we don't specify `--device-id emulator-5554`, we can see a bunch of apks in the `.apks`. Try to build without `--device-id` and unzip the result. You can see below apks.

```
 extracting: standalones/standalone-ldpi.apk  
 extracting: standalones/standalone-tvdpi.apk  
 extracting: standalones/standalone-mdpi.apk  
 extracting: standalones/standalone-hdpi.apk  
 extracting: splits/base-ldpi.apk    
 extracting: splits/base-mdpi.apk    
 extracting: splits/base-hdpi.apk    
 extracting: splits/base-xhdpi.apk   
 extracting: splits/base-xxhdpi.apk  
 extracting: splits/base-xxxhdpi.apk  
 extracting: splits/base-tvdpi.apk   
 extracting: standalones/standalone-xhdpi.apk  
 extracting: splits/base-ca.apk      
 extracting: standalones/standalone-xxxhdpi.apk  
 extracting: splits/base-fa.apk      
 extracting: splits/base-da.apk      
 extracting: splits/base-ka.apk    
...
```

We can understand the behaviour, generating apks are for specific language/resolutions. So, if we'd like to run tests for various languages, it's good to change device languages and generate apks for it and install/run tests for it.
